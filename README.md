## Features

- **Predictions:** Upload CSV files and get delivery speed predictions.  
- **Metrics:** Evaluate model performance with RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE.  
- **SHAP Plots:** Feature importance explanations for transparency.  
- **Drift Detection:** KS test to monitor changes in numeric feature distributions.  
- **Responsible AI:** Checklist for fairness, privacy, consent, transparency, and accountability.

## Responsible AI Checklist

- **Fairness:** Monitor predictions across protected groups and check for biases.  
- **Privacy:** Avoid PII and comply with privacy regulations.  
- **Consent:** Ensure data has proper consent for modeling.  
- **Transparency:** SHAP plots and metrics provide insight into model behavior.  
- **Accountability:** Maintain version control, logs, and documentation.
