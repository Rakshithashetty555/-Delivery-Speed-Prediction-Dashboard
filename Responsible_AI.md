# Responsible AI Checklist

## Fairness
- Evaluate predictions across protected groups (e.g., gender, age, region).
- Ensure no group is disproportionately negatively affected.
- Regularly monitor for potential biases in new data.

## Privacy
- Avoid using personally identifiable information (PII).
- Ensure data uploads comply with local privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- Anonymize sensitive columns before predictions.

## Consent
- Only use data that has proper consent for modeling.
- Users uploading new data acknowledge consent compliance.

## Transparency
- SHAP plots help explain which features drive predictions.
- Metrics and drift checks provide insight into model behavior and reliability.

## Accountability
- Document model updates and evaluation results.
- Maintain version control and logs for audit purposes.
